    <h1>ORDINAL</h1>
        <p>Welcome to the About Page of Ordinal, a group of students at UKIM who are passionate about Informatics and gaming.</p>
        <p>The group was founded in the computer lab of UKIM in 2019, with a shared love for playing the mobile game Mobile Legends.
        <br><br>
        <p>Since its inception, Ordinal has seen many changes in its members, but a core group of five members has remained dedicated to the group and its mission.</p>
        <p>Despite changes in membership, the group has continued to thrive and excel in its gaming pursuits.</p>
        <p>One of the key games that the group enjoys playing is Mobile Legends, and all members have achieved the coveted Mythic rank with ease.</p>
        <p>This level of skill has enabled the group to participate in both online and offline tournaments, showcasing their abilities on a larger scale.</p>
        <br>
        <p>As the years have passed, the chemistry between the five members has only grown stronger, cementing their bond as a cohesive and dedicated gaming group. </p>
        <p>With a love for gaming and a passion for Informatics, the members of Ordinal continue to push boundaries and achieve new heights in their pursuits.</p>
